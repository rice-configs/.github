# Awklesses' Rice Configurations

Store my custom rice configurations.

Feel free to explore this little organization I created to help store my rice
configurations in one place. Everything stored here is open to the public, and
can be utilized for personal use. However, I _highly_ recommend that you look
through the code of any configuration you plan on using or copying. Whatever
works for me, may not work for you!

## What is Rice/Ricing?

The term _rice_ is used to describe someone's current Unix desktop setup. The
term _ricing_ is the act of a person customizing their desktop and any software
they like to use. This includes dotfiles, i.e., special hidden configuration
files whose name starts with a dot ".".
