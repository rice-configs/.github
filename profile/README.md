# Awklesses' Rice Configurations

Store my custom rice configurations.

Feel free to explore this little organization I created to help store my rice
configurations in one place. Everything stored here is open to the public, and
can be utilized for personal use. However, I _highly_ recommend that you look
through the code of any configuration you plan on using or copying. Whatever
works for me, may not work for you!

## What is Rice/Ricing?

The term _rice_ is used to describe someone's current Unix desktop setup. The
term _ricing_ is the act of a person customizing their desktop and any software
they like to use. This includes dotfiles, i.e., special hidden configuration
files whose name starts with a dot ".".

## Contributing

All the configurations stored in this organization are open to the following
forms of contribution:

1. Improvements or additions to production code.
1. Improvements or additions to test code.
1. Improvements or additions to build system.
1. Improvements or additions to documentation.
1. Improvements or additions to CI/CD pipelines.

Use the provided templates for bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.
Please only use the bug tracker for reporting bug reports, or feature request
submissions.

Usually, each repository comes with their own contribution guidelines described
by the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Follow those guidelines in that file for a better
chance at having your contributions being merged in. Each repository also comes
with its own `SECURITY.md` file that describes what you can do if you believe
there is some kind of security vulnerability with a given configuration.
